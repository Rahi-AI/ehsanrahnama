    bio: "Hello, my name is Ehsan Rahnama , and I am excited to introduce myself as a passionate individual who has fallen in love with artificial intelligence. My journey began with a major in mechanical engineering and agricultural machinery as a subfield. During my bachelor's degree program, I struggled with theoretical physics courses but compensated in other specialized courses. I did my internship at the Khuzestan Agricultural Research Center, which sparked my interest in finding the next path. Pursuing a master's degree in renewable energy, I took a course on artificial intelligence that forever transformed my life. I researched machine learning and deep learning algorithms and worked as a research assistant for nine months at the Research Institute of Agricultural Engineering in Karaj, Alborz. I was hired by a start-up business that operates in the field of computer vision",
